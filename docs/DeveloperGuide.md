## Setting up environment

### Setting up

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/) repo, and clone the fork into your computer.
2. Ensure that you have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
   and [JDK 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) installed.
3. Configure the JDK
    * Follow the guide
      at [se-edu/guides IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure
      Intellij is configured to use JDK 11.

4. Import the project as a Gradle project
    * Follow the
      guide [se-edu/guides IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)
      to import the project into IDEA.
    * Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
5. Verify the setup
    * Locate the file `src/main/java/MediVault.java` then run the `MediVault.main()` and try a few commands
    * Run the [test](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/Testing.html) to ensure they all pass.

### Before writing code

1. Configure the coding style
    * If using IDEA, follow the
      guide [se-edu/guides IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
      to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.
2. Set up CI
    * This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows folder`). When GitHub detects those
      files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set
      up required.
## Design

### Architecture

The **Architecture Diagram** for MediVault is shown below.

![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

A quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other is given below.

The main class that runs MediVault is called `MediVault`. It is responsible for,
* At program launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the program consist of four components.
* `Command`: Executes command based on the user input that is processed by `Utilities`
  component. The list of commands can be found in our User Guide [here](UserGuide.md).
* `Utilities`: Contains important driver classes for MediVault
  * includes `parser`, `ui`, `storage` and `comparators`.
* `Inventory`: Contains a collection of classes used by MediVault to represent
different medication information.
* `Errors`: Contains collection of classes that handles exceptions during execution of MediVault.

### Command

![CommandClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/CommandClassDiagram.png)

The **Command** class diagram above shows how **Command** interact with other classes in MediVault.

The Command Component consists of **18** subclasses where each subclass represents a command feature.

Let `*` be either of the three class: `Stock`, `Prescription` or `Order`.

* `Add*Command`: Adds a new `*` information into MediVault.
* `Delete*Command`: Removes the visibility of the `*` record in MediVault.
* `Update*Command`: Updates the `*` information.
* `List*Command`: Lists the `*` records.
* `ReceiveOrderCommand`: Marks an order as received and adds the ordered medication into the current stocks.
* `ArchivePresciptionCommand`: Archives all the prescription records before a given date.
* `ArchiveOrderCommand`: Archives all the order records before a given date.
* `PurgeCommand`: Wipes all records in MediVault.
* `HelpCommand`: Shows the help page.
* `ExitCommand`: Exits MediVault.

### Utilities

The class diagram below shows how the validator classes is implemented to help ensure that the user input is
valid. `StockValidator`, `PrescriptionValidator` and `OrderValidator` inherits from `MedicineValidator`. The class
methods are also shown in the diagram.

![ValidatorClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/ValidatorClassDiagram.png)

### Inventory

The class diagram below shows how the objects in MediVault is implemented. `Stock`, `Prescription`
and `Order` inherits from the abstract `Medicine` class. The attributes that each object has is also shown in the
diagram.

![InventoryClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/InventoryClassDiagram.png)

### Errors

- `InvalidCommandException` will be thrown when the user enters an invalid command.
- `InvalidDataException` will be thrown when MediVault encountered invalid data in the data files.

## Implementation

### Main Logic

The main application logic shows how the commands are handled throughout the application. Below is the outline of the
logic:

* MediVault is called by the `main` method which calls the constructor of MediVault. Data is then loaded from the
  `Storage` class to the application.
* MediVault gets the user input via the `Ui` class and uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the input given by the
  user.
* The parameters will be parsed to a `LinkedHashMap<String, String>` to make the parameters easily accessible.
* If a valid command is received, the `CommandParser` will call the `Command` object constructor and return the object
  to MediVault.
* MediVault will then invoke the `execute()` function of the `Command` object to execute the command.

> :warning: Warning
> * Should there be an invalid command, `CommandParser` will throw `InvalidCommandException` and MediVault will display the error message using the `Ui` class.

Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within the main application logic.

![MainLogicSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/MainLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

### List Command

There are three variations of the list command.

1. `liststock`
2. `listprescription`
3. `listorders`

The sequence diagram below shows how the `list` operation works in general.

![ListSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

> :information_source: Replace `*` in the diagram with `Stock`, `Prescription` or `Order` depending on the command entered.

* All three variations of `list` are similar as they are implemented by iterating through the `Medicine` ArrayList and
  filtering out the respective object types.
* If the parameter `sort` or `rsort` is provided, the respective constructor of the `Comparator` classes will be invoked
  to help sort the ArrayList.
* For the rest of the valid command parameters, MediVault will do a **contains** comparison for strings and **equals**
  comparison for integers as well as dates except for `expiring` and `low` parameters where it will do a **less than or
  equal** comparison.
* `getAttributeValue()` represents all the get methods available in each of the respective classes. At the end of the
  execution the respective `print()` method from the `Ui` class will be called to display the respective tables.

### Stock Commands

#### AddStockCommand

MediVault creates an `AddStockCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `addstock` or `add` in `stock`
mode.
> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault adds medicine stock when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * Users will not be able to input medication if `max_quantity` is less than `quantity`.
> * MediVault will ignore the `price`, `description` and `max_quantity` of user input if the same medication name and expiry date already exist.
> * MediVault will ignore the `description` and `max_quantity` of user input if the same medication name already exist.

The sequence diagram for `AddStockCommand` is shown below.

![AddStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddStockSequenceDiagram.png)


#### DeleteStockCommand

MediVault creates an `DeleteStockCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `deletestock` or the `delete` keyword
in `stock` mode.

* MediVault allows deletion of a stock by specifying stock id.
* MediVault allows deletion of expiring stocks by specifying an expiry date.

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault deletes medicine stock information when `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault performs a check to determine if it is executing deletion by stock id or deletion by expiry then executes
  accordingly.

The sequence diagram for `DeleteStockCommand` is shown below.

![DeleteStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteStockSequenceDiagram.png)

After MediVault determines that it is executing deletion by stock id, it will execute accordingly. Currently, it only
allows for deletion of 1 stock at a time.

The sequence diagram for deletion by stock id is shown below.

![DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram.png)

After MediVault determines that it is executing deletion by expiry date, it will execute accordingly. The behaviour of
this command is to delete all stock that have <= specified date. This is because we would want to delete all expired
stock and if a date is specified, all the date before will also be expired hence implement deletion of <= date.

The sequence diagram for delete by expiry date is shown below.

![DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeletionOfStockByExpirySequenceDiagram.png)

#### UpdateStockCommand

MediVault creates an `UpdateStockCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `updatestock` or
the `update` keyword in `stock` mode.

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault checks if `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault conducts another validation check on the provided `quantity`,`max_quantity` and `expiry`
against the stored medicine stock information.

The sequence diagram for `UpdateStockCommand` is shown below.

![UpdateStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdateStockSequenceDiagram.png)

MediVault adds a new stock record when a user updates contains the `n/NAME` parameter. The old stock record still
exists in MediVault, but it will not be visible to user when listed. This approach solves the issue when a user is
unable to delete a prescription record when the medicine stock name gets updated.

### Prescription Commands

#### AddPrescriptionCommand

MediVault creates an `AddPrescriptionCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `addprescription` or  
`add` in `prescription` mode.

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault adds the prescription when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault will update the quantity left in the stock automatically after prescribing.
> * MediVault will prescribe medication with the earliest date if there are medication with multiple expiry dates.
> * Users will not be able to prescribe medication if the quantity is more than the total stock quantity.

The sequence diagram for `AddPrescriptionCommand` is shown below.

![AddPrescriptionCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddDispenseSequenceDiagram.png)

#### DeletePrescriptionCommand

MediVault creates a `DeletePrescriptionCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `deleteprescription` or
`delete` in `prescription` mode.

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault deletes the prescription when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault will delete the prescription based on the user input of `PRESCRIPTION_ID`.
> * MediVault will add the prescription quantity to the stock quantity after successful deletion of prescription.
> * User will not be able to delete prescriptions if the total quantity after prescription will be more than the maximum
  quantity.

The sequence diagram for `DeletePrescriptionCommand` is shown below.

![DeletePrescriptionCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteDispenseSequenceDiagram.png)

> :bulb: If the stock is deleted, MediVault will recover the stock and add the prescription quantity to the stock.

#### UpdatePrescriptionCommand

MediVault initialises an `UpdatePrescriptionCommand` class when CommandParser identifies
`updateprescription` or the `update` keyword in `prescription` mode.

> :information_source: Note
> * MediVault checks if the `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * When a user updates prescription information containing either `n/NAME`, `q/QUANTITY` or both, MediVault restores the 
prescribed stocks or prescribes more stocks depending on the user input.

The sequence diagram for `UpdatePrescriptionCommand` is shown below.

![UpdatePrescriptionSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdatePrescriptionSequenceDiagram.png)

MediVault adds a new prescription record when a user updates contains either the `n/NAME`, `q/QUANTITY`
parameter or both. The old prescription record is **permanently removed** from MediVault. 

This approach solves the issue when a medication is prescribed to a user with an amount that is 
**more than** the current batch of stock with the same Stock ID but **less than** the total 
stock quantity. 

> :bulb: MediVault automatically adds new prescription records when a medication is prescribed
> from stocks with different Stock IDs.

### Order Commands

### AddOrderCommand

MediVault creates an `AddOrderCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `addorder` or the `add` keyword
in `order` mode.

* MediVault adds order information when `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* As the order date is an optional parameter, MediVault will use the date the order was placed as the default date.
* Users will not be unable to add orders if the order quantity exceeds maximum stock quantity.

The sequence diagram for `AddOrderCommand` is shown below.

![AddOrderCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### DeleteOrderCommand

MediVault creates a `DeleteOrderCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `deleteorder` or  `delete` in `order`
mode.

> :information_source: Note
> * MediVault deletes the order when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.

The sequence diagram for `DeleteOrderCommand` is shown below.

![DeleteOrderCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### UpdateOrderCommand

MediVault initialises an `UpdateOrderCommand` class when CommandParser identifies
`updateorder` or the `update` keyword in `order` mode.

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault checks if the `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault restricts updating of order information that are already **delivered**.

The sequence diagram for UpdateOrderCommand is shown below.

![UpdateOrderSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdateOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

### ReceiveOrderCommand

### Archive Commands

#### ArchivePrescriptionCommand

MediVault creates an `ArchivePrescriptionCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `archiveprescription` or the 
`archive` keyword in `prescription` mode.

* MediVault archives prescription records by specifying a date.
* MediVault will remove prescription records that have date <= specified date and output it into the file named 
`data/prescription_archive.txt`

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault archive prescription information when `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault will output prescription information into a user readable format in `data/prescription_archive.txt`.
> * To modify the format, edit the code in `toFileFormat()` method in the Prescription Class.

The sequence diagram for ArchivePrescriptionCommand is shown below.

(To be implemented)

#### ArchiveOrderCommand

MediVault creates an `ArchiveOrderCommand` object when CommandParser identifies `archiveorder` or the
`archive` keyword in `order` mode.

* MediVault archives order records by specifying a date.
* MediVault will remove only DELIVERED order records that have date <= specified date and output it into the file named
`data/order_archive.txt`

> :information_source: Note:
> * MediVault archive order information when `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
> * MediVault will output order information into a user readable format in `data/prescription_archive.txt`.
> * To modify the format, edit the code in `toFileFormat()` method in the Order Class.

The sequence diagram for ArchiveOrderCommand is shown below.

(To be implemented)
