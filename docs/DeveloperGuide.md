## Setting up, getting started

### Setting up

1. Fork [this](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/) repo, and clone the fork into your computer.
2. Ensure that you have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
   and [JDK 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) installed.
3. Configure the JDK
    * Follow the guide
      at [se-edu/guides IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure
      Intellij is configured to use JDK 11.
4. Import the project as a Gradle project
    * Follow the
      guide [se-edu/guides IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)
      to import the project into IDEA.
    * Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
5. Verify the setup
    * Locate the file `src/main/java/MediVault.java` then run the `MediVault.main()` and try a few commands
    * Run the [test](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/Testing.html) to ensure they all pass.

### Before writing code

1. Configure the coding style
    * If using IDEA, follow the
      guide [se-edu/guides IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html)
      to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.
2. Set up CI
    * This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows folder`). When GitHub detects those
      files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set
      up required.

## Design

### Architecture

### Command

![CommandClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/CommandClassDiagram.png)

The **Command** class diagram above shows how **Command** interact with other classes in MediVault.

The Command Component consists of **17** subclasses where each subclass represents a command feature.

Let `*` be either of the three class: `Stock`, `Order` or `Dispense`.

* `Add*Command`: Adds a new `*` information into MediVault.
* `Delete*Command`: Removes the visibility of the `*` record in MediVault.
* `List*Command`: Lists the `*` records.
* `Update*Command`: Updates the `*` information.
* `ReceiveOrderCommand`: Marks an order as received and adds the ordered medication into the current stocks.
* `ArchiveCommand`: Archives all the records before a given date.
* `PurgeCommand`: Wipes all record in MediVault.
* `HelpCommand`: Shows the help page.
* `ExitCommand`: Exits MediVault.

### Utilities

The class diagram below shows how the validator classes in implemented to help ensure that the user input is
valid. `StockValidator`, `DispenseValidator` and `OrderValidator` inherits from `MedicineValidator`. The class methods
are also shown in the diagram.

![ValidatorClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/ValidatorClassDiagram.png)
{combine ui, storage, parser, comparators?}

### Inventory

The class diagram below shows how the objects in MediVault is implemented. `Stock`, `Dispense`
and `Order` inherits from the abstract `Medicine` class. The attributes that each object has is also shown in the
diagram.

![InventoryClassDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/InventoryClassDiagram.png)

### Errors

## Implementation

### Main Logic

The main application logic shows how the commands are handled throughout the application. Below is the outline of the
logic:

* MediVault is called by the `main` method which calls the constructor of MediVault. Data is then loaded from the
  `Storage` class to the application.
* MediVault gets the user input via the `Ui` class and uses the `CommandParser` class to parse the input given by the
  user.
* The parameters will be parsed to a `LinkedHashMap` to make the parameters easily accessible.
* If a valid command is received, the `CommandParser` will call the `Command` object constructor and return the object
  to MediVault.
* MediVault will then invoke the `execute()` function of the `Command` object to execute the command.
* Should there be an invalid command, `CommandParser` will throw `InvalidCommand` and MediVault will display the error
  message using the `Ui` class.

Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within the main application logic.

![MainLogicSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/MainLogicSequenceDiagram.png)

### AddStockCommand

MediVault initialises a AddStockCommand when CommandParser identifies the `addstock` or  `add` in the stock mode.

* MediVault adds medicine stock when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* User will not be able to input medication if `max_quantity` is less than `quantity`.
* User will not be able to input medication if the same name exist and the `expiry_date` is same.
* MediVault will ignore the `description` and `max_quantity` of user input if the same medication name already exist.

The sequence diagram for AddStockCommand is shown below.

![AddStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddStockSequenceDiagram.png)

### AddDispenseCommand

MediVault initialises a AddDispenseCommand when CommandParser identifies the `adddispense` or  `add` in the dispense
mode.

* MediVault adds dispense when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* MediVault will update the quantity left in the stock automatically after dispense.
* MediVault will dispense medication with the earliest date if there are medication with multiple expiry date.
* User will not be able to dispense medication if the quantity is more than the total stock quantity.

The sequence diagram for AddDispenseCommand is shown below.

![AddDispenseCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddDispenseSequenceDiagram.png)

### AddOrderCommand

MediVault initialises an AddOrderCommand class when CommandParser identifies the
`addorder` or the `add` keyword in the `order` mode.

* MediVault adds order information when `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* As the order date is an optional parameter, MediVault will use the date the order was placed as the default date.
* User will not be unable to add order if the order quantity exceeds maximum stock quantity.

The sequence diagram for AddOrderCommand is shown below.

![AddOrderCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/AddOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

### DeleteStockCommand

MediVault initialises an DeleteStockCommand class when CommandParser identifies the
`deletestock` or the `delete` keyword in the `stock` mode.

* MediVault allow for deletion of stock by stock id through `deletestock i/STOCK_ID`.
* MediVault allow for deletion of stock by expiry date through `deletestock e/EXPIRY_DATE`.
* MediVault delete medicine stock information when parameter and parameterValues provided by the user are valid.
* MediVault perform a check to determine if it is executing deletion by stock id or deletion by expiry and executes
  accordingly.

The sequence diagram for DeleteStockCommand is shown below.
![DeleteStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteStockSequenceDiagram.png)

After MediVault determines that it is executing deletion by stock id, it will execute accordingly.

The sequence diagram for deletion by stock id is shown below.
![DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram.png)

After MediVault determines that it is executing deletion by expiry date, it will execute accordingly.

The sequence diagram for delete by expiry date is shown below.
![DeletionOfStockByIdSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeletionOfStockByExpirySequenceDiagram.png)

### DeleteDispenseCommand

MediVault initialises a DeleteDispenseCommand when CommandParser identifies the `deletedispense` or  `delete` in the
dispense mode.

* MediVault delete dispense when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* MediVault will delete dispense based on the user input of `DISPENSE_ID`.
* MediVault will add dispense quantity to the stock quantity after successful deletion of dispense.
* User will not be able to delete dispense if the total quantity after dispense will be more than the maximum quantity.

The sequence diagram for DeleteDispenseCommand is shown below.

![DeleteDispenseCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteDispenseSequenceDiagram.png)

### DeleteOrderCommand

MediVault initialises a DeleteOrderCommand when CommandParser identifies the `deleteorder` or  `delete` in the order
mode.

* MediVault delete order when the `parameter` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.

The sequence diagram for DeleteOrderCommand is shown below.

![DeleteOrderCommandDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

### ListCommand

There are three variations of the list command.

1. `liststock`
2. `listdispense`
3. `listorders`

The sequence diagram below shows how the list operation works in general.

![ListSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

Note: Replace `*` in the diagram with `Stock`, `Dispense` or `Order` depending on the command entered.

All three variations of `list` are similar as they are implemented by iterating through the `Medicine` ArrayList and
filtering out the respective object types. If the parameter `sort` or `rsort` is provided, the respective constructor of
the `Comparator` classes will be invoked to help sort the ArrayList. For the rest of the valid command parameters,
MediVault will do a **contains** comparison for strings and **equals** comparison for integers as well as dates except
for `expiring` and `low` parameters where it will do a **less than or equal** comparison. `getAttributeValue()`
represents all the get methods available in each of the respective classes. At the end of the execution the
respective `print()` method from the `Ui` class will be called to display the respective tables.

### UpdateStockCommand

MediVault initialises an UpdateStockCommand class when CommandParser identifies the
`updatestock` or the `update` keyword in the `stock` mode.

* MediVault checks if `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* MediVault conducts another validation check on the provided `quantity`,`max_quantity` and `expiry`
  against the stored medicine stock information.

The sequence diagram for UpdateStockCommand is shown below.

![UpdateStockSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdateStockSequenceDiagram.png)

MediVault adds a new _stock_ record when a user updates contains the `n/NAME` parameter. The old stock record still
exists in MediVault, but it will not be visible to user when listed. This approach solves the issue when a user is
unable to delete a _
dispense_ record when the medicine _stock_ name gets updated.

### UpdateDispenseCommand

MediVault initialises an UpdateDispenseCommand class when CommandParser identifies the
`updatedispense` or the `update` keyword in the `dispense` mode.

* MediVault checks if the `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* When a user updates dispense information containing either `n/NAME`, `q/QUANTITY` or both, MediVault restores the
  dispensed stocks or dispense more stocks depending on the user input.

The sequence diagram for UpdateDispenseCommand is shown below.

![UpdateDispenseSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdateDispenseSequenceDiagram.png)

MediVault adds a new _dispense_ record when a user updates contains either the `n/NAME`, `q/QUANTITY`
parameter or both. The old _dispense_ record is permanently removed from MediVault. This approach solves the issue when
a user dispenses a medication with an amount that is more than the current batch of stock with the same _stock_ id but
less than the total stock quantity. MediVault will correctly add new _dispense_ records with the corresponding _stock_
Id.

### UpdateOrderCommand

MediVault initialises an UpdateOrderCommand class when CommandParser identifies the
`updateorder` or the `update` keyword in the `order` mode.

* MediVault checks if the `parameters` and `parameterValues` provided by the user are valid.
* MediVault restricts updating of order information that are already **delivered**.

The sequence diagram for UpdateOrderCommand is shown below.

![UpdateOrderSequenceDiagram](diagrams/diagram_images/UpdateOrderSequenceDiagram.png)
